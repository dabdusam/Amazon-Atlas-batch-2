E-Learning Platform with Auto Evaluation

A Java-based console application that simulates an interactive e-learning environment.
This system allows instructors to create and manage courses, while students can register, enroll in courses, and take quizzes that are automatically evaluated.

It demonstrates strong Object-Oriented Design, data persistence using serialization, and modular software architecture â€” ideal for learning core backend development concepts in Java.
